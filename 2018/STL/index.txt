Sequence Containers(Stores Objects and Data):  implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
1. Vector
2. List
3. Deque
4. Arrays
5. Forward List

Container Adaptors :  provide a different interface for sequential containers.
6. Queue
7. Priority_Queue
8. Stack

Associative Containers :  implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
9. Set
10. MultiSet
11. Map 
12. MultiMap
